I would highly discourage selling the raw and unmodified files. I don't know what the license
says about that, and I don't care all that much. There's just something unethical about selling
resources that are designated as free to the public. If you want to distribute the raw and unmodified
files for free, please consider including a link to www.gamekorp.com
